  <h3>Sam Langford</h3>
    <p>Sam Langford was born on March 4,1886 in Weymouth Falls, Nova Scotia, Canada. He passed away on January 12,1956 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Langford was former boxer who fought professionally in lightweight, welterweight, middleweight and light-heavyweight and finishing as heavyweight. He was named the “Boxer of Half-Century” by the Canadian Press. He was 5’6” but he was known as “the giant killer.
In 1917, Langford completely lost the sight of one eye during a loss against Fred Fulton. Remarkably, he would continue fighting with one eye for another nine years, the last few with limited sight out of his one “good” eye. In 1923 he captured the Mexican heavyweight title in a contest at which he had to rely on his handlers to help guide him into the ring and to his corner. Langford’s assistants were so concerned about his eyesight that they wanted to call the fight off, but Langford refused: He needed the money. Sam fought for another two years while his eyesight continued to fail, until in August 1925, in his last professional bout, he was forced to quit in the opening round of a fight when it became obvious that he couldn’t see his opponent at all.

He maintained a keen sense of humor and kind disposition throughout his life and always said that boxing provided him with a wealth of memories.

I fought maybe 600 fights, and every one was a pleasure!”  </p>
